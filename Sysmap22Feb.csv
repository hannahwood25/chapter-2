Hughes, unpubl. data). The nest signature isfaintly distinguishable to the trained eye on thesatellite image taken in January 2006. However,Letterbox is exposed to constant southeasterly tradewinds that blow across this desert landscape at aspeed of 15-35 km/hour and nest signatures arelikely to be lost through dust coverage more quicklythan on Fort Thornton. We, therefore, suggest thatnest signatures of old nests on Letterbox may last 2-8 years. However, torrential rainfall may acceleratethe process of nest signature loss. Seeds of dormantsoft feather pappus grass found on Letterboxgerminate rapidly in response to heavy rain (seeFig. 4). A mass flush occurred in 2009 and this madethe detection of abandoned masked booby nestsdifficult for observers on the ground. A mass flushalso occurred in 1995 in response to 349.2 mm ofrain during the year, which is three times the annualaverage. It is, therefore, likely that all nest sig-natures visible on the satellite image are nests con-structed some time after this mass flush in February1995. Letterbox was monitored by the AscensionIsland Conservation Office between 2002 and 2006(Radcliffe et al. 2009), but no AONs correspondingto the 117 nest signatures detected on the satelliteimage were reported. This suggests that nests in thepreviously unreported colony were constructedsome time between 1995 and 2002, in years whenno ground surveys were conducted. Further re-search is needed to determine the persistence ofabandoned nests in different habitat types toprovide estimates of the potential error in popula-tion studies based on satellite images.The method which we have employed to censusbreeding masked boobies is simple, non-invasiveand low cost. We suggest that use of GoogleEarthTMto count nests that were previously un-reported overcomes some logistical problems ofcensusing birds on the ground and can certainlyreveal unknown colonies that are worthy of furtherinvestigation. Google EarthTMimagery is availablefor most locations on the earth. Searches in the officeusing nest signatures of a target species can identifythe geographical range of nest sites.""",,The use of Google Earth™ satellite imagery to detect the nests of masked boobies Sula dactylatra,Wildlife Biology,"Hughes, B.J.; Martin, G.R.; Reynolds, S.J."

Trip identity nested within the individual was included as  a  random  term,  while  the  quasi-Poisson  family  with  a  logarithm link function for the count data was used for the error distribution. Random ARS zones were generated using Hawths tools for ArcGIS, within concentric circles centered in each colony and with 100 km and 600 km radii (max. dis-tance to the colony of short and long trips, respectively). Th  e  number of random ARS zones trip 1  generated was equal to that of real ARS zones trip 1 .;;;After  knowing  the  zones  were  the  birds  increase  their  resi-dence time (i.e. FPT), we intended to understand and quan-tify which were the environmental variables explaining higher FPT values. Th  erefore, linear mixed-eff ects models were used with FPT as the response variable to assess habitat affi  nities. Trip identity nested within the individual was included as a random eff ect in all models, whereas habitat variables (CHL, SST, DEP, their gradients and interactions) were fi xed eff ects and retained only if they improved model fi t. Environmental variables were fi rstly subjected to a cross-correlation analysis, in order to avoid problems with parameter estimations (Zuur et al. 2007).;;;Th   e  variable  retained  from  each  pair  was  the variable that produced the smallest Akaike ’ s information criteria  (AIC;  Burnham  and  Anderson  1998)  in  the  fi nal model.  Pairwise  comparison  between  environmental  vari-ables  revealed  at  least  two  highly  cross-correlated  variables,  namely DEP  versus GDEP and SST  versus GSST (Table I). From  these,  DEP  and  SST  were  included  in  the  short  trips  models,  while  for  long  trip  models  GDEP  and  GSST  were  selected.;;;We  used  AIC  and  ANOVA  to  compare  models  with  diff er-ent fi xed-eff ect structures (Crawley 2007) and identify the most parsimonious  model.  Moreover,    Δ  AIC  (i.e.  diff erence  between the estimated AIC of the fi nal model, and the estimated AIC of the previous model) was also used as a measure of model fi t. All possible combinations of main eff ects and interactions were con-sidered. FPT and depth were the only variables requiring transfor-mation [y    ln (x  	  1)]. All model residuals were examined for potential infl ated infl uence on the model output. For this model-ing procedure, we only considered two scales of ARS, the fi rst two radius giving greatest variance in log FPT. Although a third (7% of the trips) and a fourth (4% of the trips) ARS scale was present in some trips, the sample size was too small to model.;;;spearmans rank for cross correlation of environmental variables followed by linear mixed effects models with first passage time/residency as the response variable",,,,,How area restricted search of a pelagic seabird changes while performing a dual foraging strategy,Oikos,"Paiva, V.H.; Geraldes, P.; Ramírez, I.; Garthe, S.; Ramos, J.A."
